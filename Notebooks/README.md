# Hands-on Labs

These labs will be executed using the Virtual Machine created in the Software Setup. The VM runs a Linux Ubuntu 16.0.4 OS and has pre-installed the following software packages:

1. Java Open JDK 1.8
2. Apache Spark 2.2.0 (including Hadoop 2.6)
3. Anaconda Python 3.6

Jupyter Notebooks will be used as the default 'environment' for the hands-on sessions. We may occassionally use Apache Zeppelin as a demonstrator of it's capabilities.
