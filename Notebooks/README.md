2. cd spark-course
3. vagrant up ( and wait )
4. vagrant ssh

## Starting up a Notebook

A convenience script is provided : <i>start_notebook.sh</i> that will launch a PySpark shell and use the Jupyter Notebook as the driver program. On a terminal within the virtual machine (not your local computer) type:

* start_notebook.sh 

This will start-up a Jupyter notebook as the driver program of your spark application. The notebook is started up showing the contents of the Labs directory , just select the corresponding directory and notebook.
